## SOLID Principles
### Single Responsibilty Principle
#### Don't overload one object with too many responsibilty. One class has one responsibilty.

### Open Closed Principle
#### Open for extension, Closed for modification

### Liskov Substitution Principle
#### Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.
