- ## SOLID Principles
1. ### Single Responsibilty Principle
   #### Don't overload one object with too many responsibilty. One class has one responsibilty.

2. ### Open Closed Principle
   #### Open for extension, Closed for modification

3. ### Liskov Substitution Principle
   #### Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

4. ### Interface Segregation Principle
   #### Rather than having one lareg interface, make it granular .

5. ### Dependency Inversion Principle
   #### Classes from higher module should not depend on lower modules, instead on abract .Don't depend on internal            implemenations.

- ## Builder Pattern
  #### Invoke multiple methods on the same object which is as single statement.
  #### â€œSeparate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations
